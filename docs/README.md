# Fast Collections

**Fast Collections** is a **Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension** that allows you to quickly create a Smart Collection from a list of Keywords.

When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as documentaries with lots of footage and keywords, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the Smart Collection panel.

This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new Smart Collection, using a list of supplied keywords very quickly.
