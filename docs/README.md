**Fast Collections** is a **Final Cut Pro Workflow Extension** that allows you to quickly create a **Smart Collection** from a list of **Keywords**.

When you're working on massive long-form projects, such as **feature-length documentaries** with **hundreds of clips** and **thousands of keywords**, the Final Cut Pro interface can grind to a halt when using the built-in Smart Collection panel.

This simple Workflow Extension allows you to create a new **Smart Collection**, using a list of supplied keywords within seconds, rather than minutes.

If you have **thousands of keywords** across many events, it can take a long time to create a new Smart Collection with your preferred keywords directly within Final Cut Pro - but with **Fast Collections**, it can now take seconds.

You can also Generate a list of sequential numbers, for example, Scene 01, Scene 02, Scene 03, etc. This is very handy for long-form projects.
