# How To Use

When you run Fast Collections for the first time after download from the Mac App Store you'll be presented with this:

Simply click **Launch Final Cut Pro** to quit Fast Collections and Launch Final Cut Pro.

You can now access the Fast Collections Workflow Extension via the **Window > Extensions > Fast Collections** menubar item:

![](/static/menubar.png)

...or via the Workflow Extensions toolbar button:

When you open the Workflow Extension for the first time I will look like this:

You can manually write a list of keywords, or use the **Paste** button to paste them from another application.

Alternatively, you can also drag a **Final Cut Pro Event** from the Final Cut Pro Browser to the **Keywords Editor** text box, and all the keywords in that event will be populated.

Each line in the **Keyword Editor** will automatically create a new keyword item in the **Enabled Keywords** list.

You can then untick any keywords you don't want to store in the new Smart Collection.

Type the name of your new Smart Collection, then press the **Generate Smart Collection** button.

Once done, you can drag the blue icon at the bottom into your Final Cut Pro Event.

A new Smart Collection with the ticked keywords will now be created in the event.

You can also use the **Load Preset** and **Save Preset** buttons to save your list of Keywords, for times when you're using recurring keywords.

It's a very simple Workflow Extension, but can save a lot of time when working on really big libraries with lots of keywords.
